        <h4>[ PERSONALITY TYPE ]</h4>
        <p>My Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI) is <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality" target="_blank">INFP</a> [Introvert | iNtuitive | Feeling | Prospecting].

        <h4>[ FILM MAKING | PHOTOGRAPHY ]</h4>
        <p>I make movies about things that strike a chord with me. <a href="https://vimeo.com/162678074" target="_blank">'Sweeten'</a> is both about nothing and many things at once. I made it on my visit to Sweden, and hence the pun. <a href="https://vimeo.com/160848606" target="_blank">'Melancholic Times'</a> is shot in the ancient city 'Hampi'; it captures moments of contrasting inner peace and turmoil. I also make not-so-serious videos, mostly Indian college-centric ones under the banner of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9lHrJQ9Cxo" target="_blank">'Spectecool'</a> (34k+ views). While at it, you may also like to see me being kicked out of my comfort zone performing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DCPJZ2HyiQ" target="_blank">stand up comedy over here</a>.

        <h4>[ SOCIAL CAUSE ]</h4>
        <p>I am part of the LGBTQ support group in my campus called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ambar.iitkgp/" target="_blank">'Ambar'</a> which is trying to <a href="https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Ambar" target="_blank">sensitize the student community about gender diversity</a> and make the campus a better place for all students irrespective of their orientation.</p>
        <h4>[ DEBATING ]</h4>
        <p>As the member of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kgpdebsoc/info" target="_blank">Debating Society</a>, I have represented IIT Kharagpur in four national tournaments: National Law University Asian Parliamentary Debate 2012, IIT Bombay British Parliamentary Debate 2013, IIT Delhi Asian Parliamentary Debate 2013 and Kalinga School of Law Asian Parliamentary Debate 2012. I am also the Winner of the National Level Debate at Spring Fest 2015 that had 300+ participants. I was the Director of Communications at Model United Nations too in 2013.</p>
        <h4>[ LEADERSHIP ]</h4>
        <p>As the <a href="http://www.scholarsavenue.org/about-2/" target="_blank">Executive Editor</a> of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/" target="_blank">The Scholars' Avenue</a>, the campus newsbody of IIT Kharagpur, I am responsible to launch new projects and ensure their execution. I mostly take up creative assignments such as <a href="http://thescholarsavenue.github.io/Happiness/" target="_blank">'The Happiness Project'</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/scholarsavenue/photos/a.294184150131.193021.156819310131/10152941204560132/" target="_blank">'The Marauder's Map'</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thescholarsavenue/societytable" target="_blank">'The KGP Society Periodic Table'</a>, <a href="https://postimg.org/image/hq9lpfrsn/" target="_blank">'KGP: Year in Review'</a> and such. Under my leadership, the media body has seen a rise in the Facebook followers to 36k+ and monthly readership to 10k+</p>
        <h4>[ !ARCHITECTURE? ]</h4>
        <p>I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn--ttLMcYE" target="_blank">love</a>-<a href="http://www.archdaily.com/440358/why-i-left-the-architecture-profession" target="_blank">hate</a> relationship with Architecture. To me, Architecture is a field which in its essence is as <a href="https://vimeo.com/802540" target="_blank">surreal as poetry or music</a> but has been reduced to the <a href="http://www.failedarchitecture.com/what-this-mvrdv-rendering-says-about-architecture-and-media/" target="_blank">stature of make-up for real estate</a>. I think Architecture is more about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80fb7Lt0z58" target="_blank">soul and the mind</a> than about buildings. I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0MnGZ1gB4k" target="_blank">do not inted to pursue</a> the field in the way it is practiced, but I do value the impact of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEkDosanxGk" target="_blank">architectural design process</a> in all of my works. For my undergrad thesis (to be completed by July 2017), I am designing the 'Centre for Emotional Technology and Artificial Intelligence' that shall embody everything I have learnt and wish to give back to architecture.</p>
